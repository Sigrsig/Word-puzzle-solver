# Letter Boxed puzzle solver

Welcome to the Letter Boxed puzzle solver! This project was designed to help solve the New York Times [Letter Boxed daily puzzle](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/letter-boxed).
This application was created with React.

## How it works

Users can add letters to the letter boxes at the top of the page (when opened the page will have a pre-set selection of letters). When calculated the page will display possible solutions for the puzzle.

## To Dos

- Automatically update with the current day's puzzle
- Address bug where sometimes the output is empty
- Make the page look nicer
- Add a "What is this" and "How to" modal
